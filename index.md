## 🔍 Overview

The **Four-Core Motivational Model** is a foundational theory of subconscious architecture built around four elemental motivational drives:

| Drive     | Function                                     |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| ⚡ **Power**     | Agency, influence, and assertive will        |
| 🔍 **Attention** | Expression, salience, and social connection |
| 📚 **Truth**     | Understanding, verification, coherence       |
| 🕊️ **Peace**     | Stability, regulation, and protection        |

This framework provides a unified explanation for human behavior, cognitive development, and artificial motivational architecture.
