## 🧭 Overview

This repository contains the original theoretical framework for the **Unified Theory of Subconscious Motivation**, which proposes a foundational architecture of subconscious drives underlying all goal-directed behavior.

At its core is the **Four-Core Motivational Model**, structured around four elemental drives:

| Drive     | Core Function                         |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| ⚡ **Power**     | Agency, influence, assertive action       |
| 🔍 **Attention** | Expression, connection, salience         |
| 📚 **Truth**     | Understanding, alignment, verification   |
| 🕊️ **Peace**     | Stability, regulation, preservation       |

These drives shape cognition, behavior, emotion, and even system-level AI architecture.
